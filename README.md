# Meta-Learning Solution for the M5 Competition (Uncertainty)

## Introduction
The M5 Competition is the 5th Iteration of the M series of Forecasting competitions from the University of Nicosia. For this iteration, Walmart sales at different scales (from item-level to overall) are to be predicted, for a total of about 40,000 different time series to be predicted. The competition was divided into two parts: Accuracy and Uncertainty. For the accuracy part, point estimates are to be evaluated while uncertainty quantiles will be evaluated for the uncertainty part.

## Solution
For this competition, I went for the meta-learning approach
